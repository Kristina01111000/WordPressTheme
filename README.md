uses jquery and bootstrap

from the udemy class

To do: 
- put header and footer into seperate files, same on every page --> wait until uploading to wordpress b/c it may need it for upload
	- fix parallax, back ground staying still while page scrolls, not scrolling at a different speed
		-either issue with css or with js
		- problem in hero section and signup sections
	- modal submit button is not inline with the rest of the form.
