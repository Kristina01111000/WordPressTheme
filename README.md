# WordPressTheme


uses jquery and bootstrap

from the udemy class

To do: 
- put header and footer into seperate files, same on every page --> wait until uploading to wordpress b/c it may need it for upload
- on index page
	- navbar button should only be visible at small screen sizes, currently visible all the time 
		- what works:
			- the tabs go away on small screen
			- the dropdown works
			- button looks good and highlights when hovered on
			- tabs are highlighted on correct page and hrefs are all fixed
			- tabs pull right, used ml-auto
			- button shifts right, moves logo up a div and it fixed it, idk why

			
	- fix parallax, back ground staying still while page scrolls, not scrolling at a different speed
		-either issue with css or with js
		- problem in hero section and signup sections
	- modal submit button is not inline with the rest of the form.  
		- hacked fix by making modal bigger, figure out how to actually fix it
- fix on blog page
	- placeholder not showing up, not sure why
	- padding at top not working correctly
- add resources page
	- fix parallax
	- fix nav
	- add the resources
- add contact page
	- fix parallax 
	- fix nav
	- add contacts, twitter etc
	- add form
