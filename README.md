# WordPressTheme


uses jquery and bootstrap

from the udemy class

To do: 

	- put header and footer into seperate files, same on every page --> wait until uploading to wordpress b/c it may need it for upload
	
	- fix parallax, back ground staying still while page scrolls, not scrolling at a different speed
		-either issue with css or with js
		- problem in hero section and signup sections
		- i like the way it looks so i might not change it
		
	- modal submit button is not inline with the rest of the form.  
		- hacked fix by making modal bigger, figure out how to actually fix it
		
	- fix on blog page
		- placeholder not showing up, not sure why
		- padding at top not working correctly

	- add resources page
		- fix parallax?
		- add the resources

	- add contact page
