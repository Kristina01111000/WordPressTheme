# WordPressTheme

from the udemy class

using xampp and bitnami for wordpress, class uses mamp

blank theme at underscores.me
	 => much easier than writing it all out, can be edited easily

upload theme to wordpress by going to:
	themes => add new => upload zip file			
		- if you do this you need to reupload it everytime you change it
	- adding the folder manually will work better => only if you know where it is

To do: 

	- switch all files to php for wordpress
	
	- make the footer file
	
	- modal submit button is not inline with the rest of the form.  ==> in footer, fix before then
		- hacked fix by making modal bigger, figure out how to actually fix it
		

Notes:
Not putting downloaded code or pictures online
