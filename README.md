# WordPressTheme


uses jquery and bootstrap

from the udemy class
using bitnami, class uses mamp

To do: 

	- put header and footer into separate files, same on every page --> wait until uploading to wordpress b/c it may need it for upload
	
		
	- modal submit button is not inline with the rest of the form.  
		- hacked fix by making modal bigger, figure out how to actually fix it
		

Notes:
Not putting downloaded code or pictures online
