# WordPressTheme


uses jquery and bootstrap

from the udemy class

To do: 
- put header and footer into seperate files, same on every page
- on index page
	- navbar button should only be visible at small screen sizes, and should have the dropdown, currently visible all the time with no dropdown
		- fixed tabs, now they will not stay on the right side, navbar-right not working
		- button still showing up on full screen
		- the tabs go away on small screen
		- check to see if the list is inside the button on small screen
	- fix parallax, back ground staying still while page scrolls, not scrolling at a different speed
		-either issue with css or with js
		- problem in hero section and signup sections
	- modal submit button is not inline with the rest of the form.  
		- hacked fix by making modal bigger, figure out how to actually fix it
- add blog page
	- fix parallax
	- add blog posts
- add resources page
	- fix parallax
- add contact page
	- fix parallax
