# WordPressTheme


uses jquery and bootstrap

from the udemy class

To do: 
- add html to the sections
	- SIGN UP
	- FOOTER
- fix the navbar color issue
	- not fixed by adding a navbar or nav class into css with color white
- navbar button outside still wrong color, do i even need it? --> possibly remove it
- fix parallax, back ground staying still while page scrolls, not scrolling at a different speed
	-either issue with css or with js
- modal submit button is not inline with the rest of the form.  
	- hacked fix by making modal bigger, figure out how to actually fix it
- circles at bottom of instructor section have alignment issues

Notes:
Not putting downloaded code or pictures online
