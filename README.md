# WordPressTheme


uses jquery and bootstrap

from the udemy class

using xampp and bitnami, class uses mamp

blank theme at underscores.me
	 - much easier than writing it all out, can be edited easily

upload theme to wordpress by going to:
	- themes
		- add new
			- upload zip file

To do: 

	- put header and footer into separate files, same on every page --> wait until uploading to wordpress b/c it may need it for upload
	
		
	- modal submit button is not inline with the rest of the form.  
		- hacked fix by making modal bigger, figure out how to actually fix it
		

Notes:
Not putting downloaded code or pictures online
