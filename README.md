# WordPressTheme


uses jquery and bootstrap

from the udemy class

To do: 

	- put header and footer into separate files, same on every page --> wait until uploading to wordpress b/c it may need it for upload
	
		
	- modal submit button is not inline with the rest of the form.  
		- hacked fix by making modal bigger, figure out how to actually fix it
		
	- fix on blog page
		- placeholder not showing up, not sure why
		- padding at top not working correctly

	- fix on resources page
		- the padding looks wonky, something is wrong with the css
			- first 2 are right next to each other, 3rd is on the right much further

	- add contact page
		- add contacts, twitter etc
		- add form

Notes:
Not putting downloaded code or pictures online
