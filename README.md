# WordPressTheme

from the udemy class

using xampp and bitnami for wordpress, class uses mamp

blank theme at underscores.me
	 => much easier than writing it all out, can be edited easily

upload theme to wordpress by going to:

	themes => add new => upload zip file
	
		- if you do this you need to reupload it everytime you change it
		
	Adding the folder manually will work better => only if you know where it is
	
	Or use theme editor in wordpress dashboard

To do: 

	- Need to find the root of the theme to add the assets folder to the theme 
		- server is filezilla
			- the css can be updated on the wordpress theme editor
			- currently it works
	
	- current problem is in the header array 
		- partially fixed, it shows up but the the dropdown is still not working
		- need to add the menu in the menu tab on wordpress appearance section
			- partially fixed, button shows, but the menu is not inside it
			- button is not visible
				- need add menu in functions.php
				- add css and styles to fix some of the issues

	- switch all files to php for wordpress
	
	- add all the pages to the website
	
	- make the footer file
		

Notes:
Not putting downloaded code or pictures online
