# WordPressTheme


uses jquery and bootstrap

from the udemy class

To do: 
- put header and footer into seperate files, same on every page
- on index page
	- navbar button should only be visible at small screen sizes, currently visible all the time 
		- what works:
			- the tabs go away on small screen
			- the dropdown works
			- button looks good and highlights when hovered on
			- tabs are highlighted on correct page and hrefs are all fixed
			- tabs pull right, used ml-auto
		- what doesn't work:
			- button will not stay on the right side, navbar-right not working
			
	- fix parallax, back ground staying still while page scrolls, not scrolling at a different speed
		-either issue with css or with js
		- problem in hero section and signup sections
	- modal submit button is not inline with the rest of the form.  
		- hacked fix by making modal bigger, figure out how to actually fix it
- fix on blog page
	- placeholder not showing up, not sure why
- add resources page
	- fix parallax
	- fix nav
- add contact page
	- fix parallax 
	- fix nav
